Currentcost daemon
------------------

This is a simple daemon process that gathers data from a
CC128 device and then calls a script to update databases,
generate graphs/whatever is desired.

The reason for writing is that I couldn't get the commonly
used perl script to work reliably and not consume vast amounts
of CPU on my OpenBSD machine.

Config options
--------------

Configuration can be performed by the command line or from
a configuration file. Run currentcost -h to show the
available configuration options.
